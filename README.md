# Optical_Character_Recogniton-OCR-_an_Images
Develop Machine learning model for  OCR an Image

The user needs to supply the image or images to the model. The text will be extracted from the 
Image or Images  and then display on the terminal.
API core/logics can be developed around this model and can be used by software or machine learning developer


There are three projects: In the first one, I used pytesseract for OCR the text in the images. In the second one, I employ AMAZON Recognition API.
The Third one I am currently developing is using RESNET and Other Machine learning to do OCR. I am planning to use transfer learning and fine-tuning
