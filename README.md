## Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on Images

Welcome to the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on Images repository! This project focuses on developing machine learning models for extracting text from images using various techniques and APIs.
Overview

The goal of this project is to create robust machine-learning models that can accurately perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on images. Users can input images, and the models will extract text from these images, displaying the results on the terminal. Developers can integrate these models into their software or build API logic around them.

### Projects

**Project One: Utilizing Pytesseract**

This project uses Pytesseract for OCR to extract text from images. Pytesseract is a Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine.

**Project Two: Employing Amazon Recognition API**

In this project, the Amazon Recognition API is utilized for OCR. To use this API, you need to provide:

makefile

- ACCESS_KEY = "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
- SECRET_KEY = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
- REGION = "YOUR_AWS_REGION"

These details can be obtained from a free AWS account.

**Project Three: Developing OCR using RESNET and other Machine Learning techniques**

This ongoing project involves developing OCR capabilities using RESNET and other machine learning algorithms. The approach includes transfer learning and fine-tuning to enhance OCR performance.

Please note the specific technologies used in each project: ``Tesseract for the first project``, ``Amazon Recognition API for the second project``, and ``RESNET with machine learning techniques for the third project``.
