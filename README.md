# Optical_Character_Recogniton-OCR-_an_Images
The project focuses on creating Machine Learning Models for Image OCR

To develop a machine learning model for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on an image, the user will need to provide the image or images to the model. The model will extract the text from the image(s) and display it on the terminal. Software or machine learning developers can utilize the model by building API core/logic around it.

There are three projects related to OCR:

    Project One: Utilizing Pytesseract
    In this project, py-tesseract is used for OCR to extract text from images.

    Project Two: Employing Amazon Recognition API
    For this project, the Amazon Recognition API is utilized for OCR. The following details are required to use the API:

    ACCESS_KEY = "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
    SECRET_KEY = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
    REGION = "YOUR_AWS_REGION"
    These details can be obtained from a free AWS account.

    Project Three: Developing OCR using RESNET and other Machine Learning techniques
    Currently, the third project is being developed, which involves using RESNET and other machine learning algorithms for OCR. The plan is to utilize transfer learning and fine-tuning in this project.

Please note that while the first project uses Tesseract, the second project relies on the Amazon Recognition API, and the third project involves the development of OCR using RESNET and other machine-learning techniques.
